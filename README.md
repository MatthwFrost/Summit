Beginning of the mirror project.

## Early beginning
Creating simple bits of software that I want the mirror to display. It will be a hydrid of already made software and my own. Each will range in complexity.

The API is hosted on Google Cloud. Follow instructions [here](https://cloud.google.com/python/docs/setup) to install and run.
